            <h2>Quotation</h2>
            <h3 style="font-size: 140%;">A quotation is the repetition of a sentence, phrase, or passage from speech or
                text that someone has said or written. In oral speech, it is the representation of an utterance (i.e.
                of something that a speaker actually said) that is introduced by a quotative marker, such as a verb of
                saying. For example: John said: "I saw Mary today". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by
                special prosody in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation
                marks. Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed
                by citation to their original source; such statements are marked with (punctuated with) quotation marks.

                Quotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also
                widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come
                to know via hearsay.
